    As someone who likes to stay busy, I have aquired many hobbies. They not only maintain my creativity, but remind me of the vastness of our world.

    <h2>Languages</h2>
      <div>
        <p>As someone who grew up not knowing english I have grown to appreciate languages and there diversity. 
      In truth I dont remember "learning english" since I was a young child when I became exposed to it. I 
      have come to respect and admire different languages, and so throught my schooling decided to delve into 
      as many as I had access to. As of today I'm still learning as much as I can. I am fluent in spanish and english. I am trying to become proficient in ASL (American sign language). In high school and college 
      I studied French and Japanese. I wish to continue studying for as long as I am on this earth and am now exited to add coding to the list of languages that I am
      passionate about.

    <h2>Music/Art</h2>
      <div>
        <p>From a young age I've always liked to express myself both with music and art. Starting with singing (dont worry I wont torture you) I was introduced to instaments like everyone else in school. although 
            I will admit that the Recorder we all played with in elementary school is not my favorite. I have been playing Viola since i was around eleven years old. Now I have been learning piano, guitar, and would like to 
            learn to play a harp. I can somewhat manage my way around a cello but never truly practiced as my sister was the celloist in the family. I also dabble in multiple 
            medias of art. I perfer acrylic paints but and trying to expand into watercolors, oils, and digital art.

    <h2>The Outdoors!</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Camping, hiking, fishing, the park! It doesn't matter where I love being out in nature. I believe that the best 
            reset is having your puppies and loved ones around a campfire enjoying the fresh air. Our family tries to go camping at a lake for a weekend at least once a year. 
            Sometimes you have to unplug to recharge.
